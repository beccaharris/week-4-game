Crystals Collector Game

• This is just a simple guessing game. On the website, you will see a box with the heading "Target Number" - this is the number you are trying to reach.
• You'll also see a section with the heading "Your total score is: " - this is where your score will show.
• You will see pictures of four different crystals; each crystal holds a hidden and random value. Each time you click one, the crystal's value will be added to your score. 
• The goal is to make your total score equal the shown target number. 

-- The target number will be somewhere between 10 - 130
-- The crystals' values will be somewhere between 1 - 10 (multiple crystals may have the same value!)
-- The target number and the values of the crystals will reset on each win/loss!
